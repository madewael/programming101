    <h1>Programming 101</h1>

    <p>Programming101 presents a collection of articles that each explain a computer science topic by building an
        executable toy version. Hence, the focus is always understandability over completeness.</p>

    <p>The first part tackles <em>programming languages</em>. Foremost because it covers by background and education,
        but also because it forms the basics for further articles. When we build a <em>relational database</em> in Part
        II we will want to use <em>SQL</em> to query it. Well, SQL is a <em>domain specific programming language</em>
        (DSL) which will need a parser and an interpreter...</p>

        <h1>Part I : Programming Languages</h1>

        <section data-type="chapter" id="p01:intro">
            <h1>Intro</h1>

            <p>In Part I: Programming Languages we will be building an extremely simple programming language from the
                ground up. The goal is to turn a sequence of characters, the <em>source code</em>, into a useful
                computation.</p>

            <p>A first step is to turn source code into a sequence of tokens, much like humans can detect sentences in
                a text and words in a sentence. This is called lexing and is done by a lexer (<a href="#p01:lexing">see
                    lexing</a>).</p>

            <p>A second step is to turn the sequence of tokens into an <em>abstract syntax tree</em> (AST), much like
                humans expect a question (sentence) to be followed by an answer (sentence) or expect a sentence to at
                least contain a subject (word or words) and a predicate (word or words). This is called parsing and is
                done by a parser (<a href="#p01:parsing">see parsing</a>).</p>

            <p>The third step depends on the kind of language. From an execution point of view, there are two kinds of
                languages: <em>interpreted languages</em> and <em>compiled languages</em>. An interpreted language uses
                an <em>interpreter</em> to directly perform the computation (<a href="#p01:interpretation">see
                    interpretation</a>). A compiled language relies on a <em>compiler</em> to create new (executable)
                code (<a href="#p01:compilation">see compiling</a>). Both the interpreter and the compiler need to get
                their hands on an abstract syntax tree (AST).</p>

            <p>The programming language we will be building is very simple. It has only two (first-class) data types:
                strings and integers. Every program consists of a bunch (zero or more) <em>function-definitions</em>,
                followed by a single <em>expression</em>, and ends with a single <code>;</code>. This is shown in <em>The
                    Grammar of our toy programming language.</em> Everything between <code>"</code> is to interpreted as
                literal text. <code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, and <code>|</code> are to be interpreted as <em>zero or
                    more times</em>, <em>zero or one time</em>, <em>either the one or the other (or)</em>, respectively.
                Finally, <code>[ - ]</code> denotes a range, e.g., any small letter can be written as
                <code>["a"-"z"]</code>. All other constructs are called <em>non-terminals</em> and need to be looked up
                in the grammar. <code>block</code>, for instance, is defined as <code>"{" statement* "}"</code>: zero or
                more statements surrounded by curly braces, a <code>statement</code> can be either of 5 options, ...

        <section data-type="chapter" id="p01:lexing">
            <h1>Lexing</h1>
            <p>In computer science, a <em>lexer</em> is a program that converts a sequence of characters into a sequence
                of tokens. Each token is a part of the original sequence to which the lexer assigns a meaning. For our
                toy programming language we will want to start with writing a lexer. This lexer will convert a sequence
                of characters into <em>symbols</em>, <em>keywords</em>, <em>literals</em>, and <em>identifiers</em>. At
                the same time, our lexer will ignore all white space.</p>

            <p>The main data structure we will be using in lexing (and in parsing) is the <code>Queue</code>.</p>.
            <figure>
                <figcaption>A simple implementation of queue, to expose common lexing/parsing terminology .</figcaption>

</code>
</pre>
            </figure>

            <p>In our first iteration the lexer will not support symbols with a length larger than 1 (e.g.,
                <code>==</code>), or string literals. We add this functionality in a second pass. If we consider the
                grammar with these simplifications we obtain the following symbols: <code>; , ( ) = { } + - * / % &lt;
                    &gt; !</code>. Any of these symbols is always a token because they are not supposed to appear any
                where else: not in keywords, not in integers, not in identifiers. The same holds for whitespaces <code>\t</code>,
                <code>\n</code>, and <code>\r</code>, but these are also ignored.</p>

            <p>The general approach for this simple lexer is to consume all characters from the input sequence <em>one
                by one</em>, hence the use of a queue. We accumulate all these characters into the <em>next token</em>.
                When we encounter either a symbol, a whitespace, or the end of the file (<code>EOF</code>), we know we
                processed a complete token and we remember it. If we just encountered a symbol, we need to remember this
                symbol as well.</p>

            <h2 id="p01:lexing-ext">Extending the Lexer</h2>

            <p>You can continue reading here if you want the expand the functionality of the lexer a bit more. We
                will be adding extra keywords which requires almost no work. We will add support for symbols that
                consist of more than one character, which will take a bit more effort. And finally we will add
                support for string literals, which will prove to be the most difficult endeavour of the three. If you
                want to get your first programming language up, and more importantly, running as soon as possible,
                you should skip this section and continue reading about <a href="#p01:parsing">parsing</a>.</p>

            <h3>Extra Keywords</h3>

            <p>By simply adding <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> as keywords to the lexer, we are now able to
                turn a program with an if-statement into a correct sequence of tokens, i.e., where <code>if</code>
                and <code>else</code> are recognised as keywords instead of identifiers.</p>

            <figure>
                <figcaption>Adding new keywords to the list, makes them lexable.

</code>
</pre>
            </figure>


            <h3>Multi Character Symbols</h3>

            <p>When we would add <code>%</code> to the list of lexable symbols, the lexer would simply recognise this
                character as a symbol. Simply adding <code>==</code>, <code>==</code>, and <code>==</code> to the
                list of symbols, however, is not sufficient to make them lexable. This is because the lexer is to
                eager to turn characters into tokens. A first step in our lexer extension it to make the lexer a bit
                more cautious. Instead of eagerly consuming characters from the queue, we will start by peeking. When we
                encounter a whitespace, we consume it just like before. When we encounter a character that is known
                not to
                be a symbol (last branch of the if), we also consume it right away and push into the auxiliary token
                buffer. For the first and the last branch, nothing actually changed.</p>

            <p>For symbols, however, we introduce a new <em>dedicated lexer</em>, a function whose only purpose is
                to interpret the current state of a queue as if it starts with a symbol (of unknown length). First
                note that all new symbols have existing symbols as prefixes. Here, this means that the first
                character of a all symbols are symbols as well. Here, in this language we can rely on this fact. If
                this is not the case, the lexer would become even more complex.</p>

            <p>We only enter our dedicated lexer in the event of detecting a (prefix of) a symbol. Hence, it is safe to
                consume the first character in the queue, since it is known to be a symbol. If
                we add the next character to the first character and we still have a
                (known)
                symbol, we have found a two-character symbol. If not, our symbol was one of length one. To check this,
                we need to peek again. This technique, first using peek in order to consume conditionally, is
                called <em>looking ahead</em>. This can extended for symbols of any length by using a <code>while
                </code> instead of an <code>if</code>. Note that this simple implementation only works is all
                symbols have another symbol as prefix ...</p>

            <p></p>

            <h3>String Literals</h3>
            <p>The final extension to our lexer is the support for string literals. A string literal starts and ends
                with <code>"</code>. We could add this as a <em>symbol</em> to our lexer, but actually it is only used
                to denote the start and end of a string-literal-lexer-token, and has further no meaning for the
                parser for instance. Furthermore, the hardest thing about lexing a string literal is that most
                invariants that hold when lexing non-string literals do not hold: whitespaces are not to be ignored,
                symbols are not supposed to to delimit any token, and keywords hold no meaning. Hence, we introduce a
                second dedicated lexer, just like we did for symbols, using the same look ahead technique. The
                dedicated lexer for string literals will prove to be as complex as the lexer for all other items.

            <p>This works fine for nice and simple strings, e.q., <code>Hello World.</code>. But lexing a strings
                such as <code>Hamlet: "To be or not to be, ..."</code>, where <code>"</code> are actually part of
                the string itself. Many programming languages resort to the technique called <em>escaping</em> where
                an new symbol is introduced to denote that the next character(s) need to be lexed differently. The
                symbol we will be using is equally classic as the technique itself: <code>\</code>. Thus, whenever we
                encounter a
                <code>\</code> in a string token, we know we should interpret the following differently. We
                introduced <code>\</code> to be able to lex <code>"</code>, thus a <code>\</code> followed by a
                <code>"</code> is interpreted as an double quote. This solves the issue for double quotes, but
                creates an issue for backslashes. The solution is to make backslashes also escaped: <code>\\</code>
                is to be interpreted as a backslash. Finally, we can piggyback on the escaping to encode/interpreted
                special characters such as <em>return</em>, or illegal characters such as newline (many
                languages do not allow newlines are in strings). If we encounter a non-escapable character after
                <code>\</code>, the lexer will fail.

                                meaning in
                our programming language. What we observe here is that strings actually a sort of
                <em>(embedded) domain specific language</em> (hosted) in another programming language. The same
                holds for integers but we where able to hide this complexity behind the abstraction offered to use
                by JS in the form of the <code>parseInt</code>-function.</p>

            <p>This finalizes our lexer, which turns a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokes: symbols,
                keywords, strings, integers or identifiers. This sequence is further used as input for the parser,
                which is discussed in the next chapter.</p>

        <section data-type="chapter" id="p01:parsing">
            <h1>Parsing</h1>
            <p> The main job of a parser is to turn the sequence of tokens into a more structured representation
                which is called the <em>abstract syntax tree</em> (AST). While doing so, the parser verifies whether
                the input has a correct structure, i.e., checking if the input matches the grammar.</p>

            <p>As stated above, the input of a parser is a sequence of tokens. The result should be an AST that
                represents the full program. The main function <code>parse</code> turns the sequence of tokens into a
                queue of tokens and delegates to the dedicated parser <code>parseProgram</code>. For now the
                dedicated parser <code>parseProgram</code> does not do much, except show the structure of all
                dedicated parsers. Each dedicated parser accepts a queue and returns a structure that matches one of
                the grammar rules. Here, we parse a program, hence we expect a bunch of <em>function definitions</em>
                (zero, one, or more) and a single <em>expression</em>. Each program ends with a <code>;</code> but
                that is not of any meaning in an AST. Hence the name <em>abstract</em> syntax tree, not all concrete
                syntax elements need to be included, only those that still matter. In the concrete syntax the
                <code>;</code> is needed to detect the end of the expression. What remains is to implement functions
                that
                can parse (lists) of function definitions, that can parse expressions, and that can parse a
                <code>;</code>.</p>

            <p>We updated our <code>Queue</code> to throw an error whenever <code>peek</code> or
                <code>consume</code> is called on an empty queue. The code can be seen <a
                        href="https://github.com/madewael/programming101/blob/2b7a1d6945ea63b2eea318cb2697491bca8c047a/programming-languages/Queue.js">here</a>.
                Because the update is trivial, the new version is omitted from the main text.</p>

            <p>A more important update is that of the dedicated parser <code>parseProgram</code> which now delegates
                its work to an auxiliary parser and two dedicated parsers: <code>parseFunctionDefinitionList</code>,
                <code>parseExpression </code>, and <code>parseSemicolon</code>, respectively. Then, it combines the
                results into a new AST node that represents the complete program. Note that the expected semicolon is
                effectively parsed, but it is ignored afterwards. Finally, we check if the queue is empty, if not, we
                have found an illegal program and we throw a parse error.</p>

                <figcaption>The dedicated parser <code>parseProgram</code> delegates its work and produces an

            <p>For now, an implementation for <code>parseFunctionDefinitionList</code> is omitted. Hence, only
                programs without any functions are accepted. This is, if <code>parseExpression</code> where to be
                implemented completely. We again limit ourselves here, and only accept literal integer expressions.
                To do so, <code>parseExpression</code> delegates its work to <code>parseInteger</code>. This is our
                first fully functional dedicated parser: a literal integer expression always consists of exactly one
                lexer token, and it has to be of type <code>integer</code>. If this is the case, we transform the lexer
                token in an AST node of type <code>integer</code>. The value we assign to this node is the value we
                obtain, from the token. Conceptually this is a big step, in practice almost nothing changes here.
                Finally, it is important to note that our (dedicated) parser <em>throws a parse error</em>. When you
                want (or need) to parse an integer and you find something else, it is useless for <em>this
                    (dedicated) parser</em> to continue. We will see later how and when we can recover from parse errors.

            <p>The implementation for the dedicated parser <code>parseSemicolon</code> is if possible even more
                simple: we consume the next token and verify its type and value. Here, we expect it to the symbol
                <code>;</code>. If this is not the case, we encountered a parse error, hence the <code>throw</code>.
                We return the token, however this is not strictly necessary. As you can imagine, this kind of
                dedicated parser will have to be written for each and every <em>symbol</em> and <em>keyword</em>.
                Hence, we will move the logic to the <code>Token</code>, which will simplify the parsers a bit.

            <p>We add two functions to our <code>Tokens</code>:<code>is</code> and <code>ensure</code>. <code>

                error is the conditions are not met. Moreover, we make the expected value optional, which will
                prove to come in handy as well... In the remainder of this text we will omit explicit references to
                the simple dedicated parsers, i.e., the parsers for keywords and symbols.</p>

            <p>We now focus on our function definitions that may or may not precede the expression. In order the
                parse a bunch of these definitions, we need to be able to at least parse one such function definition.
                Hence, we need the dedicated parser <code>parseFunctionDefinition</code>. It very much resembles the
                dedicated parser <code>parseProgram</code>, in that is a straightforward translation from the grammar
                rule to executable code. The actual parsing of the parameter list and the body is delegated to the
                dedicated parsers <code>parseParamList</code> and <code>parseBlock</code>, respectively.

            <p>In their current implementations, <code>parseParamList</code> and <code>parseBlock</code> accept
                anything between the first open and close brackets it encounters (round or curly), they ignore the
                actual structure and return a simple list of un-parsed tokens. Hence, the only way to make them fail
                is by having an open bracket that is never closed. In this case the queue will run out of tokens and
                throw a parse error.</p>

            <p>The grammar, however, states that programs have a list of these function
                definitions. Hence, we could use <code>parseFunctionDefinition</code> to parse the first such
                definition and return it as an element is a list. If there is no function definition, the parse would
                fail because it expects to find the keyword <code>function</code> but will find an <code>integer</code>
                token. We therefore wrap our code in a <code>try-catch</code>-block to recover from an
                <em>more or less expected parse error</em>. When our parser reaches the catch block, we know the
                code does not start with a proper function definition, hence it should start parsing the expression,
                hence, the list of functions is empty.</p>

            <p>When we run our current parser of some demo programs, we see that it works fine for programs that
                have exactly one function definition followed by a literal integer as expression. However, we expected
                our parser to also accept the programs it accepted before, i.e., the programs that consist of a
                single literal integer without any functions. We observe, however, that parsing this integer fails.
                Even though we know the program is correct, we still get the following error: <em>Parse error:
                    expected a integer but got a symbol.</em> The parse error thus occurs during the execution of
                <code>parseInteger</code>, <code>parseFunctionDefinition</code> and <code>parseFunctionDefinitionList
                </code> worked fine.</p>

            <p>So ... what went wrong? The problem with our dedicated parsers is that they
                manipulate the queue. In programs that do not start with a function definition, we do <code>try</code>
                to parse a function definition. When it fails, we return an empty list and continue to try and parse
                an integer literal. Trying to parse the non-existing function definition, however, consumed the first
                token from the queue: the integer. Because <code>parseFunctionDefinition</code> expected the keyword
                <code>function</code> but received an <code>integer</code>-token, it fails fast. While <code>
                    parseFunctionDefinitionList</code> is made to recover from this expected parse error, the harm is
                already done: the queue was changed and the integer was consumed, and is never to be found again.</p>

            <p>A possible solution to this problem is to anticipate the destruction of the queue in those cases
                where a parse error is to be expected. If we where to copy the contents of the queue before parsing,
                and restore the queue to its original state if a parser error would occur, all would be fine. This is
                realised by <code>tryParse</code>: it expects a (dedicated) parser and a queue and behaves exactly
                as if the parser would have been called with the queue directly, i.e., <em>return</em> an AST node or
                <em>throw</em> a parse error. When an AST node is returned, the queue will have changed.
                In the case a parse error is thrown, however, the queue will be seemingly untouched.</p>

            <figure>
                <figcaption><code>tryParse</code> restores the contents of the queue in the case of a

            <p>We can now update <code>parseFunctionDefinitionList</code> such that it accepts any number of
                function definitions, by trying to parse them in an infinite loop. When we exit the loop, we know
                the last function definition has been successfully parsed, and the queue is restored to the state
                right after this last function definition.</p>

            <p>Now we know how we can tryout one dedicated parser and continue with another if the first one failed,
                we can create the <code>parseStatement</code> function. If we take a look at the grammar rule, we see
                that a statement does not really exist, but is rather one of five more specific kinds of statement. In
                an object oriented language <code>Statement</code> would be modeled as an <em>abstract type</em>.
                Hence, we can implements <code>parseStatement</code> by trying the dedicated parsers one by one. If
                one of these parsers is able to create an AST node, the <code>parseStatement</code> returns this
                node. This endeavour must of course result in an AST node, hence, if none of the parsers is able to
                produce an AST node, we must conclude that we encountered something that is not a statement, hence
                the parse error.</p>

            <p>The dedicated parsers we need for <code>parseStatement</code> are: <code>parseVariableDefinition</code>,
                <code>parseVariableAssignment</code>, <code>parseWhileStatement</code>, <code>parseReturnStatement
                </code>, <code>parseBlock</code>. The last one already exists, but will be refined later on. The
                first one is ignored for now.</p>

            <p>Now that <code>parseStatement</code> exists, it is possible to improve our implementation of
                <code>parseBlock</code>. Up until now <code>parseBlock</code> simply checks for <code>{</code> and consumes
                tokens until it finds a <code>}</code>. In practice, however, we are not interested in a sequence of
                tokens as body of the block, but rather want a <em>sequence of statements</em>. We can simply parse
                a <code>{</code>, then keep on parsing actual statements using <code>parseStatement</code>. As soon
                as this fails, we know we parsed the last available statement, and expect the next token to be the
                closing curly bracket (<code>}</code>). In order for this to work correctly, do not forget to use
                <code>tryParse</code> in the loop.</p>

            <p>When implementing <code>parseStatement</code> above, we skipped <code>parseVariableDefinition</code>
                because it inhibits a peculiarity not found in the other grammar rules: an optional part. The
                optional part in a variable definition defines the initial value of this variable, it can be
                <em>present</em> in the form of an expression, or <em>absent</em>. Concretely, we realise this by
                trying to parse a <code>=</code> followed by an expression. When this fails, we know the optional part
                is must be empty. We hide this logic by abstracting it away in the function <code>parseOptionally</code>
                which behaves just like <code>tryParse</code> but <em>returns</em> <code>false</code> instead of
                <em>throwing a parse error</em> in the event of a failed parse.

            <p>We now update the <code>parseParamList</code> parse to use the same technique as <code>parseBlock</code>, i.e., keep on parsing while putting the results in a list. There is one big difference,
                however, and it is not <code>()</code> versus <code>{}</code>. Note that a list of statements is
                just a list of statements. The parameter names in a parameter list, however are separated by
                <code>,</code>-symbols. We solve this by using one of the possible techniques, that is keeping a
                flag that remembers whether this is the first parameter or not. This is technically realised by
                wrapping the <code>parseIdentifier</code> parser.</p>

            <p>Besides the kind of brackets, i.e., <code>()</code> versus <code>{}</code>; and the presence or
                absence of a <em>separator</em>, <code>parseParamList</code> and <code>parseBlock</code> look very
                much alike. Later on, when we will be parsing function calls, we will see that the argument list
                follows a similar pattern. Moreover, <code>parseFunctionDefinitionList</code> also looks very
                similar: it simply has no start and no stop symbol, neither does it require a separator. Hence, we
                apply some functional abstraction and introduce an auxiliary parser function <code>parseSequence</code>, which takes the start, stop and separator symbol, and most importantly, a dedicated parser.
                It returns a list with the resulting AST nodes. The function itself is the most clumsy looking one in
                the project hitherto, but using <code>parseSequence</code> in <code>parseFunctionDefinitionList</code>, <code>parseBlock</code>, and <code>parseParamList</code> results in rather clean code. Note
                that <code>parseParamList</code> requires one post-processing step, as we are interested in the
                values only and not the complete tokes, hence the use of <code>map</code>.
